## Usage
1. Download the script **ATtiny85_Exploiter_script.ino**.
2. Modify the following variables:
	1. **scriptFileLocationPath[]**: The location for your script to be downloaded to.
	2. **hostFilePath[]**: The full path to the file on the webserver.
	3. **deleteFileAndRunHistory(int time)**: You may uncomment this line in order to make the script delete the 			     downloaded file and delete the run history.
"time" is the wait time that would be waited before deleting the file and the run history, set it to the length that your script would take to finish.
Note: The time is in miliseconds, 1000 miliseconds = 1 second; 5 seconds = 5000.
3. Upload the script to your ATtiny85.
4. Plug in the device to a PC and wait for it to start blinking, whenever it starts blinking it means that the script was executed and you may unplug the device.
